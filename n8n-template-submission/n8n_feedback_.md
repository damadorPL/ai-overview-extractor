Thank you for submitting the template **AI Overview Extractor - Google SERP Analysis with Browser Extension** to our community! We appreciate your contribution. We have reviewed your submission and have a few suggestions to further improve it:

* Title: To make the title more effective, consider these changes:
    * Start with an action verb to immediately convey the template's purpose. A suggestion could be: 'Extract and Analyze Google AI Overviews with Gemini 2.5 and Browser Extension'.
    * Incorporate the specific AI model used (Gemini 2.5).
    * Mention Google Sheets, as it's a key component for storing the data.
    * Indicate that the template generates SEO recommendations.
* Workflow: While the workflow is well-structured, renaming some key nodes can improve clarity:
    * Rename nodes like 'Markdown', 'data', 'Basic LLM Chain', 'HTML', and 'OpenRouter Chat Model' to more descriptive names. This will help users understand the purpose of each node at a glance.
